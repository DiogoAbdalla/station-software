To develop user-mode software, do the following:

1. copy \persistent\configuration\startup_settings_example.bat to startup_settings.bat
2. edit the file to use a drive that's free on your computer for a virtual drive
3. start hisparc_cmd.bat. this command creates the virtual drive if it does not exist yet, and
   sets up the right environment variables for all python stuff to work correctly.
4. cd to your directory and start your python application(s)

tip: if you want to be entirely sure that your application will work on the actual high schools,
use commands such as

  > \user\python\python.exe mytest.py

and not

  > mytest.py

This way, the shipped python interpreter is used. if your application doesn't work there,
the system deployment team probably has to add some libraries to it. 

For any questions, get in touch.
