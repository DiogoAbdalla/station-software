HiSPARC Station Software
========================

All software running on the HiSPARC stations is located in this
repository.  Notable exclusions: the data acquisition programs written in
LabVIEW have their own repositories.  The software responsible for
uploading event data and monitoring the station's health, as well as
connecting to the VPN network is all here.

The installer for the HiSPARC station software is built from this
repository.

The installer documentation can be found in the ``doc/`` subdirectory.
The documentation to set up your own development environment, as well as
the documentation that describes how the initial environment was created,
can be found in the ``doc-dev/`` subdirectory.

The documentation can be read online at http://docs.hisparc.nl/station-software/.
